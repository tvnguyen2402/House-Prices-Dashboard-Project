# House Prices Dashboard Project

The code is an R file containing code to create the app "Visualizing the '08 Housing Burst and its Consumption Implications", which is available here: https://82ofzv-tai-nguyen.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/. I created interactive maps in an R Shiny app, documenting the drops in home values and retail sales across the country during the last housing bust. On the user interface, users can select the state, metropolitan area, and year of choice, and maps of house prices and retail sales for counties in that metro area will appear. To do this, I linked county-level retail data with house prices data and with polygons encoded in GeoJSON. I then added layers of geographic data structures on an OpenStreetMap and set the view of the map to the latitude and longitude of the selected metro area.
